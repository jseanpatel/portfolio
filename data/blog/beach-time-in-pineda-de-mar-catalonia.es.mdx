# Overview (in francais)

¡Hola a todos! Bienvenidos a mi blog. Right now I'm traveling abroad Spain. To document my travels for my friends and family, I've decided to record my experiences here. I hope you all enjoy traveling with me.

A bit about the structure of this before we get into it — I hate feeling obligated to record events when I experience them. This blog isn't intended to be a diary or a Snapchat story, and I've made it a goal to avoid using devices as much as possible. So, I'm planning on using this space to record the best parts of my trip only at the end of the day when I feel like it.

# Background

To better understand the reasons for my travels, I think it's important to understand my background and how I grew up.

## Why are you in Spain?

# My Travels

Done with the background, let's get into the travels.

## Journey to Pineda de Mar

Since I'll be travelling in Europe for the forseeable future, I decided to buy an Interrail pass. With this pass I am able to easily move between European countries at a fixed, small or even no fee.

Travelling by train in this country, is in short, a pain.

The problem with going to Pineda de Mar was that

## Walking the streets

I don't know why, but I just love the aesthetic of Spanish streets. Vibrant colors, well-dressed passerby, cute animals — what more could I guy ask for. In between sightseeing I've been spending a lot of time just sitting on a bench people-watching and let me tell you it's like a whole thing in this country. If I had unlimited euros and unlimited benches, I would spend unlimited hours just watching the happenings of these cities.

By the way, one of my main objectives with this blog is sharing the cultural aspects of being Spanish — the kind of things that you can't Google.

One of the most famous Spanish sayings is:

> No pasa nada

Translated literally it means "nothing happens." Not only will you hear this phrase 100 times a day if you’re around Spaniards, I think it’s an important expression to know because it kinda sums up the Spanish way of looking at things. In general, the people here are more laid-back and less "tightly-wound" than we are in the states. Some things that we might take very seriously or think about as having dire consequences are just not as severe here.

Don’t get me wrong, you can’t skip your final exam and expect your professor to be all "no pasa nada about it." But still, there’s something freeing about escaping the infinitely-climbing mentality we have in the United States.

Overall, think of it like hakuna matata, but you're in Spain instead of Africa. Here's a picture of the gang for posterity:

## The University of Barcelona

I also spent an afternoon traveling to the University of Barcelona to code. It's fun to see how students on the other side of the world live and go to school. What's crazy is how these people literally go to school at Hogwarts, while most of us have had to settle for Unit 3. Take a look at some pictures.

Also fun fact, this website you're looking at is my brand-new developer portfolio! I've been spending a lot of time on it so if you have any feedback I'd love to hear it. If you're curious [here](https://v2.jseanpa.tel) is the link to the last version, and [here](https://v1.jseanpa.tel) is my first version from back in high school.

## La Basílica de la Sagrada Família

La Basílica de la Sagrada Família is a large, unfinished Roman Catholic basilica located in Barcelona. What's special about it, is that even though its construction began in 1882, and its building plans are very optimistic, it's famous for being incomplete (reminds me a lot of my schoolwork). Jokes aside, this is like the Statue of Liberty of Barcelona, so I had to take a look.

_DPR ARCHIVES_ - DPR LIVE, DPR IAN, DPR CREAM

I've never been a K-pop fan, but a friend sent this to me a while back and I finally got around to listening to it. It's actually fantastic. Great nighttime listen, but not in a go-to-sleep kind of way.

_Come Home The Kids Miss You_ - Jack Harlow

I might be behind times, but I also just listened to the new Jack Harlow. It's definitely different than K-pop, I'll tell you that much. Overall, I really liked it.

## Where am I headed next?

Next I'm headed to a city called Pineda de Mar, which is also located in Catalonia. It's a beach town, and I'll be there for about a week — can't wait.

## Closing note

Feel free to add any comments or reactions below. To do so, you'll have to make a GitHub account with is free and really easy. If you want to send something privately feel free to email me at [hello@jseanpa.tel](mailto:hello@jseanpa.tel). Thanks for reading, it means a lot to me. I'll see you again soon.

## Footnotes

[^1]: It's correct to say Spaniards speak Spanish, but it's more accurate to say we speak Castilian Spanish (Castellano en español). I'll be using any of these names interchangeably.
[^2]: If you have trouble keeping Spanish football teams straight, just know that this is the L team.
[^3]: Every region in Spain has their own local language. Nowadays, schoolchildren learn Spanish, their local language and usually English or French.
