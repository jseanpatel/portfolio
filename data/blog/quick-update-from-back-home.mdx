# Overview

Â¡Hola a todos! Welcome back, hope you've all been well.

Recently, many of you have been messaging me asking when the next post is coming. Writing these blog posts has been on my mind too. This is a quick post to update you all on some recent events, and what they mean for me going forward.

# Background

The following events happened several weeks after my last post.

## So what exactly happened?

I was recently driving in the mountains of northwest Spain with some others when a small fire erupted under the hood of our car. We pulled over quickly and then exited the car as soon as possible to be safe. Unfortunately, once we were away from the car, the fire spread to all parts of the vehicle. Eventually, the car itself and all of our belongings inside were burned.

**Luckily, all of us came out of it safe and completely unharmed.**

In the car I did lose all of my luggage as well as my personal bag, which included my computer. As you can imagine this has made it hard to write posts.

I also lost my passport[^1] and all of my identification papers, so the next couple of days were filled by rushing to the embassy in Madrid to avoid missing my flight.

What matters though is that everyone came out ok.

## Gotcha, so what's next?

In the end I _was_ able to catch my flight and make it home - so win. I realize there's limited time between now and the start of the school year. I still want to write a post reflecting the different cities I visted, so that I have a good record of my travels. Thus going forward, I'm planning on writing shorter posts to recap my trip. Expect more posts in the coming days.
