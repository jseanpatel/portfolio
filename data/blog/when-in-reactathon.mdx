# Overview

Hey everyone! Long time no see. While I'm not writing from my usual spot across the pond, I'm really excited to be writing again. I'm currently in San Fracisco, California for a conference called [Reactathon](https://www.reactathon.com/). I'm here to learn more about [React](https://react.dev/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I'm also here to meet other developers and learn more about the industry.

# Background

## Hold on a second, Jacob... React?? React to what?

[React](https://react.dev/) is a technology that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive websites. It helps organize the content into small building blocks, which can be combined to create powerful and responsive user interfaces. This means that the website can update and change without having to reload the entire page. Overall, React helps create modern and engaging web experiences for users.

If you think about building a website like building a house, React's small building blocks (otherwise known as its component-driven architecture) allow you to build a house with a bunch of small bricks. This is in contrast to other technologies, which might require you to build a house with a few large bricks. The small bricks are easier to work with, and allow you to build more complex websites that are closer to what you want.

And because you can make updates to your website in real-time without having to reload the entire page (which would make your experience unbearabley slow), you can change the small bricks without having to change the entire house. This is a huge advantage, and it's one of the reasons why React is so popular.

## Getting my ticket

## Hotel Kubuki

Check in on the first stay started at [Hotel Kabuki](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/california/jdv-hotel-kabuki/sfojd?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_sfojd) in the heart of Japantown (near the Filmore district). The hotel has a great vibe. On the walls are eclectic Japanese art, and the lobby is filled with plants and natural light. I took a little stroll around and I looked at vintage typewriters, old cameras, and other cool stuff. I also found a little Japanese garden, which was a nice surprise.

## MUX

## Alright, then what's the Spanish Civil War?

_Come Home The Kids Miss You_ - Jack Harlow

I might be behind times, but I also just listened to the new Jack Harlow. It's definitely different than K-pop, I'll tell you that much. Overall, I really liked it.

## Where am I headed next?

Next I'm headed to a city called Pineda de Mar, which is also located in Catalonia. It's a beach town, and I'll be there for about a week — can't wait.

## Footnotes

[^1]: It's correct to say Spaniards speak Spanish, but it's more accurate to say we speak Castilian Spanish (Castellano en español). I'll be using any of these names interchangeably.
[^2]: If you have trouble keeping Spanish football teams straight, just know that this is the L team.
[^3]: Every region in Spain has their own local language. Nowadays, schoolchildren learn Spanish, their local language and usually English or French.
