# Overview

¡Hola a todos! We're back! Loved all the comments I got - keep them coming.

I got some private comments asking about notifications when new posts go live. If you didn't already know, there is a mailing list for this blog where you can get updates when posts become available. If you want to be added to the mailing list simply submit a response in the following form, or shoot me an email at [subscriptions@jseanpa.tel](mailto:subscriptions@jseanpa.tel).

Also, someone mentioned to me that they liked how the last post had more pictures and that it made it easier to see my experiences. I totally agree. So this post I'm going to have even MORE pictures. How about that.

Without further ado, let's get started.

# Background

This time I depart from the small Pineda de Mar, Catalonia to switch regions to the very populous region of Valencia - specifically to the capital city, also called Valencia.

# Image Representations

Jacob here are some good ways to represent images since this post has so many:

## Where are you right now?

For clarity, from here on out if I say Valencia

The city of Pineda de Mar is located right along the coast in the northeastern corner of Spain. Remember, we're still in Catalonia. Pineda de Mar is fairly close to the French border, and as you might expect, shares many cultural aspects with its neighbor.

# My Travels

Done with the background, let's get into the travels.

## Train Logistics

After I got back to Barcelona, I caught a connecting train the next morning to Valencia. What was cool about this train was that it wasn't just any train, it was a bullet train. Check out these cool pictures:

As you can guess the train was very quiet and it went pretty fast.

## Barcelona Metro

Enough about travel logistics, let's look at some pictures. Here are some nice photos of the Barcelona Metro.

<div className="container mx-auto space-y-2 lg:space-y-0 lg:gap-2 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2">
  <div className="w-full rounded">
    ![Barcelona subway

    ![Barcelona subway
    track](/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/barcelona-subway-track.jpeg)
  </div>
</div>

For a city of comparable size to San Francisco, Barcelona's public transit system leaves the Bay Area in the dust. Trains came in a much higher frequency and the cost to travel was much cheaper. Even given the fact I didn't get any discounts on this train, it was only €8 for a three-hour trip - not bad. Plus seats are way nicer and the drive along the coast was very scenic.

## Hold on, where have you been staying?

I realize I skipped over my lodgings last post! In Barcelona I stayed in a [Generator](https://staygenerator.com/?lang=en-US) hostel which is a popular brand of hostels across Europe and North American. Overall it was very clean and the people were pretty nice. Plus nightly rates were very fair for a city of that size.

When I went to look for housing after Barcelona, I absolutely lucked out when my brother sent me a fantastic deal he found for a 4-star hotel in Pineda de Mar, right on the coast! Even more suprising was I could stay there for just €3 more than I was staying in the Barcelona hostel for for. Look at my room:

<div className="container mx-auto lg:space-y-0 lg:gap-2 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2">
  <div className="w-full">
    <img
      src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/pineda-hotel-room.jpeg"
      height="400"
      alt="pineda hotel room"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="w-full ">
    <img
      src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/pineda-hotel-balcony.jpeg"
      height="400"
      alt="pineda hotel balcony"
    />
  </div>
</div>

You'll notice there were two beds (with a third that you can't see in front). I of course slept in a different bed every night. What was also great was that this room was on the top floor, so I had an amazing view of the city and coastline.

This hotel was a quick 5-minute walk from the beach. This made getting around very easy.

## Walking the streets

<img
  src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/pineda-streets.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="pineda streets"
/>

Here's a nice picture I got while walking around. One thought that came to mind when I took this picture is how much these streets looked like they were a painting. The colors are very vibrant and warm, and it seemed to be sunny everyday I was here except the last.

## University of Pineda de Mar

As many of you know I'm also studying education, so I love the idea of visiting the local university in each of the cities I visit. Unfortunately, Pineda de Mar doesn't have a university as it's a smaller, beach town. So, University of Pineda de Mar isn't a real thing - gotcha!

Nonetheless, be on the lookout for university pictures at my next stop.

## What have I been eating?

Thanks to some great feedback on the last post, I realized I never really explained what I was eating, or more importantly, how meals even work in this country. So let's walk through it step by step.

Spanish breakfast is usually light, a coffee or some pastry. This is in contrast to an English or American breakfast which is usually heavier. Lunch time in Spain though is usually the largest meal of the day. Here, dinner-time types of foods are usually eaten around midday. This includes many Spanish favorites like [paella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paella)[^2] for example. Dinner is lighter but still a full meal.

Since I operate on tourist rules, eating conventions are a bit different. Basically all Spanish restaurants serve what's called the menu del día. This is a list of courses that guests choose based on what is fresh and available for the restaurant that day.

Here's a picture of a menu of the menu del día that was posted outside of a restaurant I thought about going to.

<img
  src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/menu-del-dia.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="menu del día"
/>

Notice that there are a standard three courses - an appetizer, a main course and a dessert. What's cool about eating this way is that all the extras are included. This means a beverage[^3] of your choice, olives for the table, fresh bread and a pastry with coffee for dessert. All of this is usually €10 to €12.

My expert opinion: **_a pretty good deal._**

What I've been doing is eating one large meal at midday. The problem is el menu del día is only available for a couple hours, usually between 1 PM and 3 PM, so if you miss it you're out of luck!

I'm planning on discussing Spanish cuisine every week. In the meantime, enjoy this meal that I took pictures of. I added descriptions on each picture, so we can be foodies together.

**Course 1:** Cold Salad with Pasta

<img
  src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/cold-salad.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="cold salad"
/>

This salad was pretty yummy. That sauce you see on top is a mixture of mayonnaise and some house sauce. Also notice the [Vichy Catalan](https://www.vichycatalan.com/en/our-brands/vichy-catalan-genuine/), which is a very good brand of Spanish carbonated water. It's famous for its distinctly salty taste.

**Course 2:** Merluza with Fries

<img
  src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/merluza-with-fries.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="merluza with fries"
/>

Merluza (also known as Hake) is a type of fish that is extremely common in Spain. In fact, [half](<https://www.seafoodsource.com/pricing/market-reports/spain-has-its-hake-and-eats-it-too#:~:text=The%20annual%20consumption%20of%20hake,and%20Aquaculture%20Products%20(EUMOFA)>) of all the Merluza eaten in Europe is eaten in Spain! The lemon on the side was a nice touch. Most second courses are served with fries or some kind of side like salad.

**Course 3:** Coffee with Milk

<img
  src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/coffee-with-milk.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="coffee with milk"
/>

I've never been much of a coffee drinker, but I'm really enjoying drinking coffee at the end of meals. I also like how the coffee isn't too large. I've been switching through different types of coffee every meal to try to figure out what I like. This meal I only got a coffee for dessert, but sometimes your coffee also comes with a pastry. Again, this is all included in the single price for the meal.

## Calella, Catalonia

I also took a day trip to a nearby city of Callela. This was about an hour walk, which was actually quite nice because I got to see a lot of the city. I spent the day browsing local bakeries and I even stopped by the local fish market. Take a look:

<img
  src="/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/calella-fish-market.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="fish market"
/>

I finished off the day with a trip to the beach. As far as beaches go, this one was middle of the pack. But still a good outing either way.

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2  xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">

    ![Calella
    sea](/static/images/beach-time-in-pineda-de-mar-catalonia/calella-sea.jpeg)
  </div>
</div>

Really nice view of the ocean right? Nope, I got you again! That's actually the Mediterranean Sea. Remember, we're still on the eastern coast of Spain, so to see the Atlantic Ocean we have to cross the country.

_Yumeno Garden_ - Last Dinosaurs

This group is so underrated. If you haven't heard of them, they're an indie rock band from Brisbane, Australia. I've been trying to expand my music go-to's, and they've delivered consistently. This a great album of theirs so give it a listen. Also my favorite song by them is Flying, so listen to that too. In fact, I'll just link it below.

_Flying_ - Last Dinosaurs

Trust me, just listen to this.

## Where am I headed next?

Next up I'm changing regions and heading to Valencia. I'll be staying in the capital city of the region, also called Valencia. Yes, Valencia the city, in the province of Valencia in the region of Valencia. Not confusing at all.

## Closing note

## Footnotes

[^1]: The euro is the currency used across most [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) countries. The euro is worth just a bit more than the American dollar, and right now is exchanged at 1.05 USD per euro. The euro symbol is €.
[^2]: Paella is from the region of Valencia, which is where I'm headed next. I'll talk more about this special dish next post.
[^3]: In Spain, there are no complimentary beverages - even flat water. Every meal you have to buy your own drinks even. The good news is all beverages are pretty cheap by American standards, and usually you only spend about $1.50 USD on your drink, whether that be beer, soda or water.
