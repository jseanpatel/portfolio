# Background

In this one I head south from the city of Valencia, to Alicante, another city in the region of Valencia.

## Where are you right now?

Right now I'm in Alicante, Spain which is a province (and city) near the very southern tip of Valencia.

Again, here's the region of Valencia on a map:

# My Travels

Done with the background, let's get into the travels.

## Where did you stay?

In Alicante I decided to get away from the hostel a little bit and I booked a stay in [Ibis Budget Alicante](https://all.accor.com/hotel/3511/index.en.shtml?utm_campaign=seo+maps&utm_medium=seo+maps&utm_source=google+Maps). I was able to find a fantastic deal for an eight night stay, but the only catch was the hotel was about a 40 minute walk from the city central. Me being me I decided to go and book it anyways because there just so happened to be a botanical garden, a cliffside view and of course a white-sand beach to walk along as I went back and forth.

This was probably the most walking I've done in such a short period - ever. Seriously, I must have set some kind of tourist record in this process. If you know anyone who can verify this let me know.

## Lots of Walking

In case you were curious, here's an actual table of the steps and distances I walked during my stay. I am _staunchly_ anti-taxi, so I even trekked across the city into the next city by foot some days.

| Date      | Steps Walk  | Distance (miles) |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Day 1     | 9,439       | 4.9              |
| Day 2     | 30,004      | 15.8             |
| Day 3     | 37,473      | 19.8             |
| Day 4     | 32,538      | 17.2             |
| Day 5     | 28,678      | 15.1             |
| Day 6     | 23,402      | 12.3             |
| Day 7     | 24,527      | 12.9             |
| Day 8     | 19,521      | 10.3             |
| Day 9     | 18,757      | 9.9              |
| **Total** | **224,339** | **118.2**        |

If you know someone who can verify these nine days broke _some_ record, then have your people call my people.

In case you were wondering this is what my walk to and from the hotel looked like:

A quick stop by a very large arboretum with a bunch of different types of frogs

A view across the open water

A pass by the the mountain range that ran nearby squeezing the city with the coast

## Walking the streets

With all this walking I was also able to see a lot of really cool sights.

## University of Alicante

Unfortunately, there was no university within walking distance of where I was staying, and trains are only for when I'm coming and going between my stays. Sorry university, you're out of luck this time.

## Castle of Santa Bárbara

## What have I been eating?

Food here was a continuatino of many of the dishes I had in the city of Valencia. Here's a nice meal I had before I left:

**Course 1:** Ham and Cheese Salad with Vinaigrette

<img
  src="/static/images/city-streets-and-sights-in-valencia/valencia-meal-salad.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="valencia meal salad"
/>

Another excellent salad to start things off. One thing about Spain is that salad isn't boring. In the US if we hear ~~sadlad~~ salad, I think we have a tendency to groan and envision a depressing pile of leaves doused in a bucket of dressing. But here it's different. If you're ever in Spain, reignite your relationship with salad.

**Course 2:** Chicken Paella with Lima Beans

<img
  src="/static/images/city-streets-and-sights-in-valencia/valencia-meal-paella.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="chicken paella with"
/>

Now that we've learned what paella is together, let's enjoy this yum picture of some chicken paella I had for the main course. To be clear, this is not the whole paella, but just a little portion they gave me from the much, much larger plate. Paella is usually cooked in huge frying pans to serve many people.

**Course 3:** Coffee with Milk

<img
  src="/static/images/city-streets-and-sights-in-valencia/valencia-meal-cafe.jpeg"
  width="400"
  alt="coffee with milk"
/>

Of course, ending with another good coffee. While this is a coffee with milk, one thing I've learned here is to be weary of ordering beverages with dairy. In Spain, the vast majority of people don't drink fresh milk like we do in the US, so if you order a dairy drink in the wrong place, you run the risk of getting powdered, or worse, spoiled milk - gross.

Though, larger bars and most cafes are safe, so you can rest assured.

# Miscellaneous

## What have I been listening to?

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/660eXTPUwKkCOYvWIr6sPl?si=fc06195c5e1346d8">

    alt="Mild High Club - It's Over Again"
  />
</a>

_It's Over Again_ - Mild High Club

Here's a good track from a quieter pop band from Chicago. One thing about Alicante is that it was so, so hot. In fact, during my stay it was the peak of the heatwave in western Europe. Regardless, this is a nice relax and look at the water kind of song.

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ryp5LkAWyJwRqoFd8N7Kk?si=5f4c9c6ec5d746b3">

    width="400"
    alt="move - brb."
  />
</a>

_brb._ - move

Continuing with the on-the-beach theme, here's another good track I found during my stay. See how there's a period after the group name? Based on some of the previous hits I've found during my travels, I'm convice that if you find any groups or songs with a period after their name then they will also be a hit. Seriously, prove me wrong.

## Where am I headed next?

Next, I'm switching things up and heading south to the city of Murcia, which is located in the region with the same name. I'm planning on looking at a famous art museum and cathedral in the center of the city.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Reminder that this is the team that we like, Hala Madrid
[^2]: A friend of mine told me that this type of horchata looks like pancake batter. I've been a Spaniard for the past 21 years, but I have to say, they have a point.
