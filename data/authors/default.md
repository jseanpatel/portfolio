Hi there,

I'm Jacob. I'm a student studying computer science and education at the University of California, Berkeley. Welcome to my blog.

I really hate structure. So, I intend for this blog to be a conduit for my sporradic thoughts, both technical and personal.

Right now I'm travelling Western Europe, and let me tell you this trip is going great. Coming up I've got an opera show, a stay in a monastery and even a day on a nude beach (nude). Join me on my travels.

Jacob
