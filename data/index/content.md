I'm a rising senior at the University of California, Berkeley studying computer science and education, with an emphasis in educational technology. I'm a dual Spanish-American and I split time growing up in [Redding, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redding,_California) and [Orense, Espa√±a](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orense).

In 2016, I ran the following code for the first time (and I mean these _exact_ lines):

```java:HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Over the next three years, I enjoyed a smorgasbord of technical projects like an [iOS application](https://github.com/jseanpatel/flyright) where you fly a broken spaceship, a [webtool](https://maribel.io) to help adult learners reacclimate to university paper-writing and a complete Python [curriculum](https://treetoplearning.org/) aimed at bringing rural students into computer science.

Now as an undergraduate, the majority of time is spent teaching, and polishing my freelance website design agency [Ladder Designs](https://ladderdesigns.co). Right now, my agency is closing PR's on an [online tabulation system](https://atabical.calmocktrial.com/), which we are building for undergraduate programs to track tournament information efficiently.

Feel free to reach me at [hello@jseanpa.tel](mailto:hello@jseanpa.tel). Also since you're here, stop by my [blog](./blog) and let me know what you think.

Let's build something together.
