I'm a rising senior at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) studying computer science and education, with an emphasis in educational technology. I'm a dual Spanish-American citizen and I split time growing up in [Redding, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redding,_California) and [Orense, Espa√±a](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orense).

In 2016, I ran `git commit -m "first commit"` on the following lines:

```java:HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Over the next three years and 1900 commits, I enjoyed a smorgasbord of technical projects like an [iOS application](https://github.com/jseanpatel/flyright) where you fly a broken spaceship, a [webtool](https://maribel.io) to help adult learners reacclimate to university paper-writing and a complete Python [curriculum](https://treetoplearning.org/) aimed at bringing rural students into computer science.

Now that I'm an undergraduate, the majority of time is spent making software to help facilitate learning that sticks. I do this mostly through my freelance website design company: [Ladder Designs](https://ladderdesigns.co). Right now we're closing PR's on an [online tabulation system](https://atabical.calmocktrial.com/), which we're building so undergraduate [mock trial](https://www.collegemocktrial.org/) teams can track tournament information more efficiently.

I love to meet new people. Feel free to reach me at [hello@jseanpa.tel](mailto:hello@jseanpa.tel) or check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zn7AY7H7qoi3dBHJk6UciWDOOvsibOyN). Also since you're here, stop by my [blog](./blog) and let me know what you think.

Let's build something together.
